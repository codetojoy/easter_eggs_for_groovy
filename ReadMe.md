[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/codetojoy/easter_eggs_for_groovy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/codetojoy/easter_eggs_for_groovy)

## Introduction

"Easter Eggs" does not refer to the secret-codes/tricks in video games! 

Define an 'egg' to be a foothold example that helps you understand, or grow, some Groovy. I like to keep examples/eggs around for reference, and wanted to share with the world. 

Most examples are done entirely in tests. (Some are true unit tests and others are closer to integration tests)

### Requirements

* assumes Groovy and Gradle are installed
