*** Introduction

Easter's Eggs. 

This does not refer to the secret-codes/tricks in video games! 

Define an 'egg' to be a foothold example that helps you understand, or grow, some Groovy.

I like to keep examples/eggs around for reference, and wanted to share with the world. 

An interesting thing is that, as of this writing, these examples are done entirely in tests!

*** Requirements

-- assumes Java 5+ is available
-- assumes Groovy and Gant are available
